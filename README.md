# WritingEfficientPrograms

Example code taken from the book [The Art Of Writing Efficient Programs](https://www.packtpub.com/product/the-art-of-writing-efficient-programs/9781800208117?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781800208117) by Fedor G. Pikus. 

The repo contains code readaptations and notes to the book's version. The original book repo can be found [here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/The-Art-of-Writing-Efficient-Programs). Each subfolder in the repo roughly corresponds to a book chapter. 

The repo's goal is to investigate and explore various methods to improve code efficiency using C++, but the ideas and concepts can be extended to any compiled language. These includes getting a better feel of a system's hardware and memory management, as well as correct concurrent program design.
